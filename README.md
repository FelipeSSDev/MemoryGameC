# MemoryGameC
Memory Game project created in pure C for my "Programming 2" degree,  done in my second semester
It runs directly from terminal so it doesn't really have an inferface

The idea was to keep everything in a single file so it's quite big, but shouldn't be super confusing to go through
No it actually is quite confusing

I had to meet some criteria to create this but I can't find the file my prof gave me a year ago lol
